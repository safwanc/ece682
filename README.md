### Linear State Feedback Controller Design for Bipedal Locomotion
In order to run the design procedure and produce all of the plots/figures obtained for the report call the `DesignStateFeedback.m` script in Matlab.

### Overview
The goal of this project was to apply a simple linear control design technique (state feedback) to stabilize a bipedal robot being modelled as a 3D LIPM \[1\]. The ultimate goal for this project is to design a walking control strategy for a bipedal robot based on the ZMP \[2\] criterion. Additional details about the project can be found on this page about my [MASc Research][1].
